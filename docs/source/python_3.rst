Python 3
========

Currently, Terrarium is targeted towards Python 2.x. The production
environment in which Terrarium is used relies on many third-party, closed-source
tools that use embedded versions of python 2.x. It us unknown to when, or if,
these tools will move to Python 3. This makes prioritizing Python 3
compatibility difficult to justify.

However, Python 3 is the bright future of python, and it is up to package
authors to contribute to that future by ensuring their libraries are
compatible. We will do our best to accommodate Python 3 as time allows.
